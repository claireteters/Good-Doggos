                Sometimes it's a good idea when you are having a bad day to just look at pups. They will gloop and glob and wag henlo and
                be all happy and yes please, all because they hope to make your day pawfect. 13/10 will make you feel much
                better.

                        Being a rescue pup is only for the bravest of hounds out in the world. It takes all shapes and sizes for these relentless
                        frens to help one another. It can be hard and scary but their stuffed frens and real life people
                        frens help them stay safe. 13/10 good girl Frida.

            <p>Here is a little doggo getting ready to fill some big paws! Training is vigorus and requires lots of attention
                and less play than a normal pup can usually enjoy. 12/10 you are a saint, little fluff.

            <h2>Good house pups</h2>

            <p>
                Sometimes it's the hardest job being a house pup. They tend to be in charge of the house when their best frien human disapears
                every day, loved on too much, overly-pet by house guests, constant disruption of the floor naps, and stuffed
                frens getting lost. 12/10 dressed very well for the happy occasion.

            <p>
                Hopping into the rolling fast thing is a high time of life for these pups. They could be going to the pet store for more
                stuffed frens, a park to get sticks and leaves to bring home, to go see other play doggos, and last but not
                least... visit the doctor. Which we all hope no pups ever have to endure again. 12/10 very impressive lip
                wings.
